This is my first attempt at a RUST language project.
The application is terminal-based and runs as a client-and-server system.
Above is an image of a working prototype of the project. 
I am currently in the process of learning RUST using YouTube tutorials and look forward to delving into better projects, and applications.
Thanks for being here!
